### RISC-V ZKVMs: the Good and the Bad
- RISC‑V-based ZKVMs dramatically speed up ZK development and can be performant via precompiles, but there are also serious concerns around reproducible builds and compiler miscompilation/security when proving “compiled program execution.”

### Tokenization Privacy Solutions: An Institutional Review
- This blog reivews what “privacy” means for institutional tokenization and surveys concrete privacy approaches and platforms (e.g., permissioned ledgers, L1/L2 confidentiality features, and ZKP/FHE-based solutions), comparing their tradeoffs in compliance, trust assumptions, functionality, and operational complexity.

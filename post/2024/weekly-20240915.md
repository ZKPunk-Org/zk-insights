## Highlights
### What Does It Mean To Know?
这是一篇探讨零知识中的知识的含义的博客，ZK-proofs 是加密货币最伟大的进步之一。但是，哲学家对 "知识" 的研究已有千年历史。在这篇文章中，我将比较哲学家对知识定义的 "合理真实信念" 理论和 ZK- proofs 所隐含的知识规范。另外，博客还畅想了如果将 ZK- proofs 的知识范围推广到 NP 语言之外，可能带来的新变化。
ZK- proofs are one of crypto's greatest advancements. But "knowledge" has been studied by philosophers for 1000s of years. In this post, I compare the “justified true belief” theory of knowledge with the specification of knowledge implied by ZK-proofs

### Designing high-performance zkVMs
这是一篇来自RISC Zero的博客，介绍了关于高性能零知识虚拟机的设计。主要包括两个部分：
在第 1 部分中，作者对 RISC Zero 的 zkVM 所依赖的证明系统进行概述，并介绍他们在提高 zkVM 性能方面的计划。
在第 2 部分中，作者仔细研究证明系统的每一层，包括与折叠方案、JOLT、Binius 和 Circle STARKs 等创新有关的设计因素。
This article is a deep-dive into proof system design for zkVMs, split into two parts.

In Part 1, we give a high-level overview of the proof system that underlies RISC Zero’s zkVM, and what’s on our horizon for improving zkVM performance.

In Part 2, we’ll take a closer look at each layer of the proof system, touching on design considerations with respect to innovations such as folding schemes, JOLT, Binius, and Circle STARKs.

### Introducing zkDL++ 
Ingonyama 提出的证明任何深度神经网络完整性的前沿框架。 演示：为 @AIatMetaStable 签名提取可证明的水印
A cutting-edge framework for proving the integrity of any deep neural network.

### Provable Watermark Extraction
zkDL++ is a novel framework designed for provable AI. Leveraging zkDL++, we address a key challenge in generative AI watermarking: Maintaining privacy while ensuring provability. By enhancing the watermarking system developed by Meta, zkDL++ solves the problem of needing to keep watermark extractors private to avoid attacks, offering a more secure solution. Beyond watermarking, zkDL++ proves the integrity of any deep neural network (DNN) with high efficiency.

## Updates
### Yuval Ishai: Dot-Product Proofs
A dot-product proof is a simple probabilistic proof system in which the verifier decides whether to accept an input vector based on a single linear combination of the entries of the input and a proof vector. I will present constructions of linear-size dot-product proofs for circuit satisfiability and discuss two kinds of applications: exponential-time hardness of approximation of MAX-LIN from ETH, and minimizing verification complexity of succinct arguments.

### Quang Dao: Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge from LPN and MQ
We give the first construction of non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) arguments from post-quantum assumptions other than Learning with Errors. In particular, we achieve NIZK under the polynomial hardness of the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) assumption, and the exponential hardness of solving random under-determined multivariate quadratic equations (MQ). We also construct NIZK satisfying statistical zero-knowledge assuming a new variant of LPN, Dense-Sparse LPN, introduced by Dao and Jain (CRYPTO 2024), together with exponentially-hard MQ.

### New Directions in Property Testing | Richard M. Karp Distinguished Lecture
Property testing algorithms seek to determine whether an unknown massive object has some particular property of interest, or is "far" from having the property, while inspecting only a tiny portion of the object. Recent years have witnessed significant progress on both classic property testing problems and the development of several new property testing problems and frameworks, motivated by connections to machine learning theory and high-dimensional data analysis. In this talk, Rocco Servedio will survey several of these new property testing problems, models, and results.

### Sphinx (A fork of SP1)
Sphinx is an open-source zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) that can prove the execution of RISC-V bytecode, with initial tooling support for programs written in Rust. Additionally, Sphinx aims to support other reduction engines, including the evaluator for the Lurk programming language , which could be extended to other functional languages like JavaScript or Lean.

## Papers

### Mova: folding without committing to error terms and without sumcheck
Mova 以 Nova 的折叠方案为基础，通过在验证器采样的随机点对 $\mathbf{E}$ 和 $\mathbf{T}$ 的多线性扩展 (MLE) 进行评估，从而避免对 Nova 的所谓误差项 $\mathbf{E}$ 和交叉项 $\mathbf{T}$ 做出承诺。 

Mova, which is based on the Nova folding scheme, manages to avoid committing to Nova's so-called error term $\mathbf{E}$ and cross term $\mathbf{T}$ by replacing said commitments with evaluations of the Multilinear Extension (MLE) of $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{T}$ at a random point sampled by the Verifier.

### What Have SNARGs Ever Done for FHE?
Does the SNARG actually add any meaningful security to input privacy? We address this question in this note and give a security definition that meaningfully captures the security of the FHE plus SNARG construction.

### Hᴇᴋᴀᴛᴏɴ: Horizontally-Scalable zkSNARKs via Proof Aggregation
我们介绍 Hᴇᴋᴀᴛᴏɴ，它是一种可以高效处理任意大型计算的 zkSNARK。我们通过一个新的 "分发-聚合 "框架来构建 Hᴇᴋᴀᴛᴏɴ，该框架将大型计算分解成小块，在分布式系统中并行证明这些小块，然后将得到的小块证明聚合成一个简洁的证明。这个框架的基础是一种新技术，用于高效处理各块之间共享的数据。

We introduce Hᴇᴋᴀᴛᴏɴ, a zkSNARK that can efficiently handle arbitrarily large computations. We construct Hᴇᴋᴀᴛᴏɴ via a new "distribute-and-aggregate" framework that breaks up large computations into small chunks, proves these chunks in parallel in a distributed system, and then aggregates the resulting chunk proofs into a single succinct proof. Underlying this framework is a new technique for efficiently handling data that is shared between chunks.

### Collaborative CP-NIZKs: Modular, Composable Proofs for Distributed Secrets
We present the first, general definition for collaborative commit-and-prove NIZK (CP-NIZK) proofs of knowledge and construct distributed protocols to enable their realization. We implement our protocols for two commonly used NIZKs, Groth16 and Bulletproofs, and evaluate their practicality in a variety of computational settings. Our findings indicate that composability adds only minor overhead, especially for large circuits.

### More Optimizations to Sum-Check Proving
We describe an optimization to the sum-check prover that substantially reduces the cost coming from the eq $(w, x)$ factor. Over large prime-order fields, our optimization eliminates roughly $2^{n+1}$ field multiplications compared to a standard linear-time implementation of the prover, and roughly $2^{n-1}$ field multiplications when considered on top of Gruen's optimization. These savings are about a $25 \%$ (respectively $10 \%$ ) end-to-end prover speedup in common use cases, and potentially even larger when working over binary tower fields.

### Efficient Layered Circuit for Verification of SHA3 Merkle Tree
We present an efficient layered circuit design for SHA3-256 Merkle tree verification, suitable for a GKR proof system, that achieves logarithmic verification and proof size.

### Foldable, Recursive Proofs of Isogeny Computation with Reduced Time Complexity
We empirically build a system to prove the execution of the circuit computing the isogeny rather than produce a proof of knowledge. This proof can then be used as part of the verifiable folding scheme Nova, which reduces the complexity of an isogeny proof of computation for a chain of $n$ isogenies from $O(n)$ to $O(1)$ by providing at each step a single proof that proves the whole preceding chain.

### Benchmarking Attacks on Learning with Errors
To improve our understanding of concrete LWE security, we provide the first benchmarks for LWE secret recovery on standardized parameters, for small and low-weight (sparse) secrets. We evaluate four LWE attacks in these settings to serve as a baseline: the Search-LWE attacks uSVP, SALSA, and Coo & Cruel, and the Decision-LWE attack:  Dual Hybrid Meet-in-the-Middle (MitM).

## Highlights
### Pairings for the Rest of Us
文章基于作者从各种公开课程和资料学习的经验，介绍了基于域扩展的椭圆曲线配对的基础概念，重点包括弗罗贝尼乌斯自同态和 Trace 映射，以帮助建立 $\mathbb{G}_1$ 和 $\mathbb{G}_2$ 子群，并逐步实现泰特配对。
In this article, we covered the foundational concepts for understanding elliptic curve pairings over field extensions, focusing on the Frobenius endomorphism and the Trace map to identify subgroups $\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\mathbb{G}_2$ and implemented the Tate pairing step-by-step.

### coCircom: Collaborative Circom
coCircom is a tool for building coSNARKs, a new technology that enables multiple distrusting parties to collaboratively compute a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). It leverages the existing domain-specific language circom to define arithmetic circuits. With coCircom, all existing circom circuits can be promoted to coSNARKs without any modification to the original circuit. Additionally, coCircom is fully compatible with the Groth16 backend of snarkjs, the native proofing system for circom. Proofs built with coCircom can be verified using snarkjs, and vice versa.

### Nexus 2.0: Jolt, HyperNova, and a New SDK
Nexus 2.0 与上个月发布的 1.0 zkVM 相比，引入了一些关键的新组件，推动了性能和效率的提升： 
- 由 Jolt 算术化系统支持的新证明器前端
- 由 HyperNova 递归证明系统支持的新证明器后端
- Nexus SDK，一个用于大规模并行生成多个证明的编程框架
A new prover frontend, powered by the Jolt arithmetization system
A new prover backend, powered by the HyperNova recursive proof system
The Nexus SDK, a programmatic framework for producing multiple proofs in parallel and at scale
- <https://blog.nexus.xyz/nexus-2-0-jolt-hypernova-and-a-new-sdk/>

A key component of the Nexus 2.0 zkVM is a new SDK, a programmatic framework for computing multiple zkVM proofs at scale. It supports each of our Nova, HyperNova, and Jolt backends, enabling easy configuration to tailor proving to specific applications. Dynamic compilation, private input, public output, and logging support together provide a rich programmatic interface to guest programs. A simple, misuse-resistant design makes using the Nexus zkVM to prove even complex programs a straightforward process.

### Dot-Product Proofs and Their Applications
点积证明（DPP）是一个简单的概率证明系统，其中输入语句 $\mathbf{x}$ 和证明 $\pi$ 是有限域 $\mathbb{F}$ 上的向量，而证明是通过对 $\mathbf{x}$ 和 $\pi$ 进行单个点积查询 $\langle \mathbf{q}, (\mathbf{x} \| \boldsymbol{\pi}) \rangle$ 来验证的。DPP 可以看作是一个 1-query 完全线性 PCP。论文还讨论了 DPP 的可行性和效率。
A dot-product proof (DPP) is a simple probabilistic proof system in which the input statement $\mathbf{x}$ and the proof $\pi$ are vectors over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$, and the proof is verified by making a single dot-product query $\langle \mathbf{q}, (\mathbf{x} \| \boldsymbol{\pi}) \rangle$ jointly to $\mathbf{x}$ and $\pi$. A DPP can be viewed as a 1-query fully linear PCP. We study the feasibility and efficiency of DPPs.

### Designated-Verifier zk-SNARKs Made Easy
Propose a construction of strong designated-verifier zk-SNARKs. The construction inspired by designated verifier signatures based on two-party ring signatures does not use encryption and can be applied on any public-verifiable zk-SNARKs to yield a designated-verifiable variant.

### On cycles of pairing-friendly abelian varieties
One of the most promising avenues for realising scalable proof systems relies on the existence of 2-cycles of pairing-friendly elliptic curves. In this paper, the authors generalise the notion of cycles of pairing-friendly elliptic curves to study cycles of pairing-friendly abelian varieties, with a view towards realising more efficient pairing based SNARKs.

### Quasi-Linear Size PCPs with Small Soundness from HDX
A fantastic new result by Bafna, Minzer, and Vyas shows what can be viewed as a version of the PCP theorem of @IritDinur in the low soundness regime. They do so  using high-dimensional expanders and ideas from fault-tolerant distributed computing. It's interesting to note that ideas from fault tolerance also recently arose in the setting of the quantum PCP conjecture. This (perhaps unexpected) connection between PCPs and fault tolerance seems to be quite promising.

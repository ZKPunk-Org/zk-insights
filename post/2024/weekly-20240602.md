### Polyhedra Expander Compiler Collection
The ExpanderCompilerCollection is a component of the Expander proof system. It transforms circuits written in gnark into an intermediate representation (IR) of a layered circuit. This IR can later be used by the Expander prover to generate proofs.

### The first ZKP Verify Code Implementation using Bitcoin Script

Zulu Network team has Open-Sourced the first ZKP Verify Code Implementation using Bitcoin Script, involving mainstream algorithms such as Groth16/FFlonk. This achievement lays the foundation for constructing a decentralized bridge based on BitVM2. It is based on the **On Proving Parings** paper whch significantly reduces the overall script size.

### On Proving Pairings - Andrija Novakovic

This paper explores efficient ways to prove correctness of elliptic curve pairing relations. First shows that the final exponentiation step of pairing verification can be replaced with a more efficient “residue check,” which can be incorporated into the Miller loop. Then shows how to reduce the cost of the Miller loop by precomputing all the necessary lines, and how this is especially efficient when the second pairing argument is fixed in advance. Instantiateing algorithms and show results for the BN254 curve.

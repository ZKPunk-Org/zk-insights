### Greyhound: Fast Polynomial Commitments from Lattices
A new super fast and compact polynomial commitments from standard lattice assumptions! Greyhound combines the techniques that me and Khanh explored in FMN23 and SLAP with the LaBRADOR proof systems, constructing a super exciting and concretely efficient post quantum PCS, with a blazing fast vectorized AVX-512 implementation included. Just to give some numbers, for degree 2^30 proofs are 53KB and only take 3 minutes to compute!

### ZK Podcast Episode 335: Groth16, IVC and Formal Verification with Nexus
In this week’s episode, Anna chats with Jens Groth and Daniel Marin from Nexus. They catch up on all things Groth16 with the author himself before diving into a variety topics, such as formal verification in the context of ZKPs, the Nexus architecture, the benefits and challenges of building a system from the ground up, folding and IVC plus the properties these offer in a zkVM context and much more.

## Learnings
### Cryptography 101 : Kyber and Dilithium
Video lectures for Alfred Menezes's introductory course on Kyber-KEM and the Dilithium signature scheme. These lattice-based cryptographic scheme were standardized by NIST on August 13, 2024.

### Cryptography 101: Error-Correcting Codes
This course is an introduction to algebraic methods for devising error-correcting codes. These codes are used, for example, in satellite broadcasts, CD/DVD/Blu-ray players, memory chips, two-dimensional bar codes (including QR codes), and digital video broadcasting. The mathematical ingredients for the course are linear algebra, elementary number theory (integers modulo n and congruences), and abstract algebra (groups, rings, ideals, and finite fields).

## Highlights
### Is Telegram really an encrypted messaging app?
Apropos Pavel Durov’s arrest, cryptographer Matthew Green wrote a short post about whether Telegram is an “encrypted messaging app”. The TL;DR here is that Telegram has an optional end-to-end encryption mode that you have to turn on manually. It only works for individual conversations, not for group chats.

### How Does Math Keep Secrets?
Cryptography is the thread that connects Julius Caesar, World War II and quantum computing, and it now lies under nearly every part of modern life. In this week’s episode, computer scientist Boaz Barak and co-host Janna Levin discuss the past and future of secrecy.

## Updates
### A major breakthrough in multiplication over Bitcoin, and in STARK verification on Bitcoin signet
A new algorithm for M31 multiplication reduces multiplication cost by 70%. Unlike STARKs, this new multiplication algorithm (like the previous algorithm) does not require OP_CAT, cementing M31’s status as a Bitcoin-friendly prime, regardless of OP_CAT.

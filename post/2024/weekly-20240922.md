## Highlights
### Friends don’t let friends reuse nonces
This blog post tells a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when implementing a relatively basic type of cryptography: a bidirectional encrypted channel, such as an encrypted voice call or encrypted chat. We’ll explore how more subtle issues of this type can arise in a network with several encrypted channels, and we’ll describe a bug we discovered in a client’s threshold signature scheme.

### powdr: a toolkit that helps build zkVMs and similar proof frameworks.
It has two main components:
1. powdr-asm: an extensible assembly IR language to perform dynamic executions.
2. powdr-PIL: a low level constraint language that allows you to define arithmetic constraints, lookups, etc. It includes a functional meta-constraint language to describe how constraints are generated.

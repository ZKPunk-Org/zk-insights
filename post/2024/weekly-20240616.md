## Highlights

### Ronkathon: Learn Cryptography from First Principles
Ronkathon是受Plonkathon启发的一组密码原语的 Rust 实现。旨在展示应用密码学的理论特性以及编程语言中的具体应用的技术内容。Ronkathon是根据第一性原理构建的，因此无需了解外部库或详细依赖项（除rand和itertools之外）。大部分代码并未针对数学透明度和简洁性进行优化。

### Episode 327: Proof Aggregation with Shumo and Yi from NEBRA
In this week’s episode Anna chats with Shumo and Yi from NEBRA. They discuss the high price of putting ZKPs on-chain before diving into NEBRA’s proposed solution to mitigating this, their Universal Proof Aggregation product. They cover what it takes to incorporate extra pricing systems into NEBRA UPA as well as the benefits that these systems will bring, how developers are meant to interact with them, and future integrations to enable seamless cross-zkRollup applications. The group round off by discussing prover marketplaces, verification aggregation systems, and the design space that this all opens up.

### Pairings in Cryptography
Dan Boneh 介绍了 pairing 的原理和计算 pairing 的算法, 还讲了相关的应用, 比如可以利用 pairing 构建 BLS 签名和门限签名. <https://youtu.be/8WDOpzxpnTE?si=JIguXJMSss9dru1A&t=1992> 这里很搞笑, 说 pairing 的公式是法国数学家 Andre Weil 在二战期间的 2 年监狱服刑中搞出来的(因为拒绝当兵), 之后他在自传中建议法国数学家都去监狱中待两年, 因为确实很高产

### Fancy cryptography in the wild
Curated list of deployments of fancy cryptography. Cryptography counts as fancy if it uses primitives beyond symmetric ciphers, (EC)DH as key agreement, digital signatures, public key encryption such as RSA-OAEP, or KEMs, or uses those primitives in unusual ways, especially if it relies on properties beyond IND-CCA2.

## Papers
### Polymath: Groth16 Is Not The Limit
Proposes a zk-SNARK Polymath for the Square Arithmetic Programming constraint system using the KZG polynomial commitment scheme.  Polymath has a shorter argument than Groth16.  At 192-bit security, Polymath's argument is nearly half the size, making it highly competitive for high-security future applications.

### Leveled Fully-Homomorphic Signatures from Batch Arguments
We do not have homomorphic signatures with features such as multi-hop evaluation, context hiding, and fast amortized verification, while relying on standard falsifiable assumptions. In this work, we design homomorphic signatures satisfying all above properties. Constructing homomorphic signatures for polynomial-sized circuits from a variety of standard assumptions such as sub-exponential DDH, standard pairing-based assumptions, or learning with errors.

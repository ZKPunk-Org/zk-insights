### Zerocoin to zk-creds: Modern ZK History with Ian Miers
In this episode, Anna Rose (https://x.com/annarrose) and Nico Mohnblatt (https://x.com/nico_mnbl) catch up with Ian Miers (https://x.com/secparam) from the University of Maryland (https://www.cs.umd.edu/), starting with his work on seminal ZK blockchain research, Zerocoin and Zerocash and the creation of the first zk-focused blockchain project Zcash. They then explore the history of trusted setups, including the trusted setup bug discovery in Zcash, and subsequent improvements like Powers of Tau. Ian also discussed his work on ZEXE, a system that has inspired the formation of Aleo, and his more recent works: zk-creds for building flexible anonymous credentials from existing identity signals like passports, and zk-promises for supporting anonymous reputation, moderation, and callbacks in decentralized systems. They also touch on broader topics like post-quantum security considerations, sybil resistance, and the need for programmable privacy tools.

## Papers

### A SNARK for (Non-)Subsequences with Text-Sub-Linear Proving Time
In this paper, the authors present a subsequence scheme that separates proving either a subsequence or a non-subsequence argument into two phases: (i) proof of preprocessing and (ii) proof of (non-)subsequence argument, and achieve a text-sublinear proving time.

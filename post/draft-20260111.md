### A SNARK for (Non-)Subsequences with Text-Sub-Linear Proving Time
In this paper, the authors present a subsequence scheme that separates proving either a subsequence or a non-subsequence argument into two phases: (i) proof of preprocessing and (ii) proof of (non-)subsequence argument, and achieve a text-sublinear proving time.

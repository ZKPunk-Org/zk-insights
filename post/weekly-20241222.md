## Highlights
### Introducing OpenVM
At Axiom we're excited to announce OpenVM, a performant and modular zkVM framework built for customization and extensibility. Designed in collaboration between Axiom, Scroll and individual contributors including Max Gillett, the v0.1 release of OpenVM includes proofs of unbounded length Rust programs, onchain verification, and VM extensions including ECDSA, optimal Ate pairing, and int256 and modular arithmetic.

### Formally Verified Cryptographic Proof Systems
This library aims to provide a modular and composable framework for formally verifying cryptographic proof systems (e.g. SNARKs) based on Interactive (Oracle) Proofs. This is done as part of the Verified zkEVM project.

### ZKryptium
This library enables the creation of zero-knowledge proofs, exposing cryptographic primitives facilitating the development of a Verifiable Credentials (VCs) system capable of handling both Anonymous Credentials and Selective Disclosure Credentials.

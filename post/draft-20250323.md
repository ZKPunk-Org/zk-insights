### I can prove I’ve solved this Sudoku without revealing it
I can convince you that I’ve solved a sudoku without giving you any information about my solution. We discuss how to do this using what cryptographers call a zero-knowledge proof, and how the same tricks can be used for almost any other problem you can think of.

### Quantum Speedup Found for Huge Class of Hard Problems
It’s been difficult to find important questions that quantum computers can answer faster than classical machines, but a new algorithm appears to do it for some critical optimization tasks.

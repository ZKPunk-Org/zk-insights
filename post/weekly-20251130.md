## Highlights
### More efficient Lattice Folding via ℓ₂-Norm Checks
This blog post introduces a more efficient lattice-based folding scheme by replacing expensive ℓ∞-norm checks with ℓ₂-norm checks, leveraging techniques from Johnson-Lindenstrauss projections. The approach improves prover efficiency while maintaining security, and proposes a final "shortening" step to ensure exact norm bounds during extraction. It advances the practicality of post-quantum folding schemes for real-world applications.

本文提出一种更高效的格基折叠方案，通过引入 ℓ₂ 范数检查替代传统的 ℓ∞ 范数检查，显著降低了证明者的计算开销。该方法结合 Johnson-Lindenstrauss 投影与最终「缩短」步骤，确保提取过程中见证向量的范数精确受控，为后量子时代的可扩展证明系统提供了更实用的构建路径。

### zkID (Anonymous Credentials), w/ Ying Tong
'In this module, Nicolas Mohnblatt and Ying Tong explain the critical need for privacy-preserving digital ID systems using zk-SNARKs. She first covers existing systems, but shows how the methods used are flawed. These existing systems may inadvertently expose linkability and observability, allowing issuers and verifiers to track users across different presentations. The proposed solution, zkID, is a zk-SNARK architecture, which acts as a privacy layer over existing credentials. This method conceals the static signature and data, enabling private, unlinkable presentations to be verified without requiring issuers to change the cryptography underlying their systems. The discussion also covers advanced topics like credential revocation, deniable presentation, the out-of-protocol risks of de-anonymization, and the technical trade-offs between different ZK proof systems and the importance of standardization in the road to wide-scale adoption.'

针对现有数字 ID 系统暴露用户行踪（可链接性与可观察性）的问题，zkID 引入 zk-SNARKs 作为隐私层。该方案能隐藏凭证签名与数据，实现验证的匿名与不可链接，且无需发行方更改其原有密码体系。

### Pratyush Mishra on Tiny Proofs, Folding, Low-Memory SNARKs and More
'In this episode, Anna Rose and Nico Mohnblatt catch up with Pratyush Mishra, Assistant Professor of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. They discuss the various themes in his ZK research and some of the works he has been a part of in the last few years. They explore how Garuda and Pari achieve extremely small SNARK proofs, how Arc facilitates hash-based folding, proximity proofs with FICS and FACS, his work on low-memory SNARKs, and ZK applications outside the blockchain space.

Pratyush shares how these ideas intersect with one another, from faster proving to smallest proof sizes to real-world uses. He also touches on his collaborations with other leading cryptographers like Benedikt Bünz and Alessandro Chiesa, and how ZK is finding its place in broader computer science.'

在本期节目中，Anna Rose 和 Nico Mohnblatt 与宾夕法尼亚大学计算机与信息科学系助理教授 Pratyush Mishra 进行了交流。他们探讨了 Mishra 在零知识证明 (ZK) 领域的研究方向，以及他近年来参与的一些工作。他们深入探讨了 Garuda 和 Pari 如何实现极小的 SNARK 证明，Arc 如何促进基于哈希的折叠，FICS 和 FACS 如何实现邻近性证明，Mishra 在低内存 SNARK 方面的工作，以及 ZK 在区块链领域之外的应用。

Mishra 分享了这些理念之间的相互联系，从更快的证明速度到更小的证明规模，再到实际应用。他还谈到了他与其他顶尖密码学家（如 Benedikt Bünz 和 Alessandro Chiesa）的合作，以及 ZK 如何在更广泛的计算机科学领域中找到自己的位置。

### Speeding up sumcheck: an in-depth walkthrough of our implementation
This post details the Rust implementation of Algorithm 6 from the BDDT paper, optimizing the sumcheck protocol for Ethereum’s Lean zkVM. By combining Small Value Optimization (SVO) and Eq-Poly techniques, it reduces prover time and proof size, enabling efficient base-to-extension field transitions and communication savings.

本文深入讲解了 BDDT 论文中第六算法在 Rust 中的实现，优化了以太坊 Lean zkVM 的 sumcheck 协议。通过结合 SVO 和 Eq-Poly 技术，显著降低了证明者计算成本与证明大小，实现了高效的字段转换与通信优化。

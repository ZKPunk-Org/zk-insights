## Highlights
### Introducing OpenVM
At Axiom we're excited to announce OpenVM, a performant and modular zkVM framework built for customization and extensibility. Designed in collaboration between Axiom, Scroll and individual contributors including Max Gillett, the v0.1 release of OpenVM includes proofs of unbounded length Rust programs, onchain verification, and VM extensions including ECDSA, optimal Ate pairing, and int256 and modular arithmetic.
